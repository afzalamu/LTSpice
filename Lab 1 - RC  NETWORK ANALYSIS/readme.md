# RC Circuit Design and Simulation - README

S.No.: **9**

## Objective
To design and simulate an RC circuit for the given cutoff frequency.

**Cutoff Frequency** (Fc) = (S.no. * 10) + 100 Hz  
So, Fc = 190 Hz

## Design
As we know, for an RC circuit:  
Fc = 1 / (2 * Ï€ * RC)

Assuming the value of the capacitor to be 1uF, then from the above formula:  
Value of Resistor (R) = 837.66 ohms  
Hence, RC time constant is 0.837 milisecond  

## Schematic in LT SPICE
Input given is the square pulse using the following command:  
`PULSE(0 5 0 1u 1u 6m 12m)`    
Suitable time period should be chosen for the Pulse Signal by observing the RC time constant.

## Simulation Results
This circuit will act as a Low Pass Filter with a cutoff frequency of 190Hz. We verify it using the simulation by performing AC analysis and plotting the Transfer Function with the following command:  
`.ac dec 10 1 250`

The simulation results were in accordance with the given specification, as Fc obtained from the Transfer Function graph is also 190Hz.

Now, as we know the capacitor gets fully charged in 5 * Time constant, and we will verify it using transient analysis and calculate the charging time of the capacitor from the resulting waveforms.  
Transient analysis is performed using:  
`.tran 15m`  
Suitable time period should be chosen in the above command by observing the time period of the given input pulse signal.

From the resulting waveform, we can observe that the time taken to get the capacitor charged to its 99 percent value is near to 5 * RC time constant value, and hence the results are verified.
